Each Bogie object contains attributes such as bogie name and seating capacity.
Multiple bogie objects are stored in an ArrayList collection.
The program first displays all passenger bogies present in the list.
The list is then converted into a stream using stream().
A filter condition is applied to select bogies with capacity greater than 60.

UC11: Validate Train ID & Cargo Codes (Regex)
This module demonstrates input validation using Regular Expressions (Regex) in Java.
The program accepts Train ID and Cargo Code inputs from the user using the Scanner class.
The expected format for Train ID is TRN-1234, where the last four characters are digits.
The expected format for Cargo Code is PET-AB, where the last two characters are uppercase letters.
The matches() method is used to validate the input against predefined regex patterns.
Regex pattern TRN-\d{4} ensures the Train ID follows the required numeric format.
Regex pattern PET-[A-Z]{2} ensures the Cargo Code contains two uppercase letters.
The program displays whether each input is valid or invalid based on pattern matching.
This use case demonstrates data validation using Java Regular Expressions and user input handling.

This module demonstrates performance benchmarking between traditional loops and Java Streams.
Each Bogie object contains attributes such as bogie type and seating capacity.
A dataset of bogie objects is created to simulate train consist data processing.
The program measures execution time using System.nanoTime() for high-resolution timing.
A traditional for loop is used to filter passenger bogies with capacity greater than 100.

Execution time for both approaches is calculated by subtracting start and end timestamps.
The results display loop-based and stream-based processing durations in nanoseconds.
This use case demonstrates performance comparison and benchmarking techniques in Java.

UC14: Handle Invalid Bogie Capacity (Custom Exception)
This module demonstrates error handling using a custom exception in Java.
A custom exception class InvalidCapacityException is defined to handle invalid seating capacities.
The PassengerBogie class validates seating capacity within its constructor.
If the seating capacity is less than or equal to zero, the custom exception is thrown.
This ensures that invalid passenger bogies cannot be created in the system.
The program attempts to create both valid and invalid bogie objects.
The invalid case triggers the custom exception, preventing incorrect object creation.
The exception is handled using a try-catch block to maintain safe program execution.
This use case demonstrates fail-fast validation and robust error handling using checked exceptions.

UC15: Safe Cargo Assignment Using try-catch-finally
This module demonstrates runtime safety validation using structured exception handling in Java.
A custom runtime exception CargoSafetyException is defined for unsafe cargo assignments.
The GoodsBogie class represents a goods wagon with attributes such as shape and cargo type.
The assignCargo() method validates cargo assignments based on predefined safety rules.
If an unsafe combination is detected, the method throws a CargoSafetyException.
The program attempts to assign multiple cargo types to different bogies.
The try-catch block captures and handles unsafe cargo assignments gracefully.
The finally block executes after every attempt to log the cargo assignment process.
This use case demonstrates robust runtime validation using custom exceptions and try-catch-finally blocks.

UC16: Sort Passenger Bogies by Capacity (Bubble Sort – Algorithm Intro)
This module demonstrates manual sorting using the Bubble Sort algorithm in Java.
A list of passenger bogie seating capacities is created using List.of().
The list is converted into an array to perform element swapping during sorting.
The Bubble Sort algorithm compares adjacent elements in each pass.
If a value is greater than the next value, the elements are swapped.
Multiple passes are performed until all elements are arranged in ascending order.
The algorithm ensures that larger capacities gradually move to the end of the array.
The program finally displays the sorted passenger bogie capacities.
This use case demonstrates basic sorting algorithm implementation and understanding of algorithmic logic in Java.

A list of bogie names is created using an ArrayList collection.
The program first displays all available bogie names in the system.
A search key is defined to represent the bogie that needs to be located.
The program performs a sequential traversal through the list.
Each element is compared with the search key using the equals() method.

The program then displays whether the bogie was found or not found in the list.
This use case demonstrates basic searching logic using sequential traversal in Java.

UC19: Binary Search for Bogie ID (Optimized Searching)
This module demonstrates efficient searching using the Binary Search algorithm.
A list of bogie names is created to represent sorted train consist data.
The program first displays all available bogie names in the list.
A search key is defined to identify the bogie that needs to be located.
Binary Search works by dividing the search range into two halves repeatedly.
The middle element is compared with the search key to determine the next search range.
If the key is greater than the middle value, the right half of the list is searched.
If the key is smaller, the left half of the list is searched.
This use case demonstrates optimized searching using the divide-and-conquer technique in Java.

UC20: Exception Handling During Search Operations
This module demonstrates defensive programming using runtime exceptions in Java.
A collection of bogie IDs is created to represent train consist data.
The program defines a search ID that needs to be located in the list.
Before performing the search, the system validates whether bogie data exists.
If the collection is empty, the program throws an IllegalStateException.
This prevents execution of invalid search operations on empty data.
If data exists, the program performs a sequential search through the bogie IDs.
The result indicates whether the specified bogie ID was found or not found.
This use case demonstrates fail-fast validation and safe error handling in Java applications.
